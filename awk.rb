    This is Brian Kernighan's "new awk" or "BWK awk". It has been
    installed as "nawk", and you can access the man page as "man nawk".

    If you want to use it as "awk" add the "xpg4bin" directory to your
    PATH from your bashrc like:

        PATH="#{opt_libexec}/xpg4bin:$PATH"

    And you can access the man page by adding the "xpg4man" directory to
    your MANPATH from your bashrc as follows:

        MANPATH="#{opt_libexec}/xpg4man:$MANPATH"

    EOS

    assert_match(/^Working!$/,
      shell_output("#{bin}/nawk 'BEGIN { print \"Working!\"; exit(0); }'"),
                )
  end
